### Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets

This repository contains a Python Notebook for sentiment analysis of Hinglish twitter data using Pretrained XLM-Roberta BERT Model.

## Usage

This Notebook has been run and tested in Google Colab. It will not run on Windows without extensive setup. It might run on Linux but adjustments to the code will have to be made. Follow these instructions to run it on Colab:
- This repository also contains a file called data.zip. Upload it in Colab when you open it with the link at the end.
- If you want to run the code in Colab, it would be better to connect to a GPU runtime. The code will automatically run on GPU if one is available.
